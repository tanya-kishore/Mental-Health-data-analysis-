# Mental-Health-data-analysis-

This project aims to analyze the relationship between various factors and individuals' perceptions of their mental health history. The analysis includes data related to gender, occupation, self-employment status, family history of mental health issues, lifestyle factors (such as days indoors and outdoor activity), growing stress, coping struggles, and social weakness. The goal is to understand how these factors influence individuals' mental health history perceptions, as indicated by their responses ("Maybe," "No," "Yes").

Analysis Approach

    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
        Cleaned and preprocessed the raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy in the analysis.
        Handled missing values, outliers, and data formatting issues as necessary.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of variables and identify patterns or trends.
        Calculated descriptive statistics and visualized data using plots and charts to gain insights.

    Statistical Analysis:
        Utilized statistical techniques such as chi-square tests to examine the relationships between categorical variables (e.g., gender, occupation) and mental health history responses.
        Analyzed percentages, frequencies, and associations to draw meaningful conclusions.

Key Findings

    Identified associations between different factors (e.g., gender, occupation, lifestyle) and individuals' mental health history perceptions.
    Observed higher levels of uncertainty ("Maybe" responses) in certain demographic or lifestyle groups.
    Highlighted the need for targeted interventions and support systems tailored to specific needs based on these findings.

Future Work

    Further qualitative research and surveys to delve deeper into the underlying reasons behind observed perceptions.
    Continuous monitoring of mental health indicators and periodic analyses to track changes and assess the effectiveness of interventions over time.
